# Fantastic Kernel — Claude Code working notes

A medium that unifies humans and AIs into a single workspace. Recursive
`Agent` class + a `Kernel` shared-context object, one primitive
(`send(target_id, payload)`), plugin-discovered bundles. Every agent
answers `{type:"reflect"}` — the universal discovery verb.

> **This is the canonical reference implementation** of the Fantastic
> protocol. When other runtimes (`swift/`, the Apple app's embedded
> kernel) disagree with this kernel on wire shape, on-disk format,
> verb payloads, or reflect output, the other runtime is wrong. The
> protocol surface lives in this file (sections "Architecture",
> "Universal patterns", "Storage policy") — no separate spec doc.
> Cross-runtime drift is caught mechanically by
> `swift/Tests/FantasticParityTests`, which spawns this kernel and
> byte-diffs replies.

```

**No client library. The protocol IS the API.** A code agent (Claude,
LLM CLI) bootstraps from `.fantastic/readme.md` on disk, or from a single
WS `kernel.reflect` round-trip (open `ws://host/<any-agent>/ws`, send a
`call` frame with `target:"kernel", payload:{type:"reflect", readme:true}`).

## Composition principle — NO architectural automation

The system is built by **conscious operator decisions** (the LLM/human composing
it). NO bundle auto-spawns children; NO agent acts autonomously. The **only
autoagent is the loader** (persistence/hydration): the root `fs_loader` on disk +
its peers (a host `web/fs_loader` for the frontend, the JS `proxy_loader`)
mechanically save what the operator built and restore it. Everything else —
composition, membership, wiring — is an explicit `create_agent` / `update_agent` /
`delete_agent`. This is *why* binding is weak (agents reference peers by id, never
couple), why setup is documented procedure (create a `web` agent, then create its
`web_ws` / `web_rest` / `fs_loader` children), and why the host knows nothing of
the frontend. Declared-config metas the substrate wires (not behavior): `alias`
(reach an agent by a stable name), `root` (a loader serves a sub-namespace),
`watch` (a loader only answers verbs), `children_dir` (the on-disk container dir
name — default `agents`; set `host_agents` / `web_agents` for a self-describing
layout). The JS kernel is the SAME kernel — same fields, same flexibility (its
loader lays out the disk). When you reach for "X should automatically do Y,"
stop: the operator does Y, consciously.

## The substrate as a workflow medium (meta)

What this system *is*, beyond "a tree of agents": a medium where **compute,
inference, and memory are interchangeable units, addressed by id, wired from
anywhere — across kernels.** Read it on the two-kernel example (host Python +
browser JS, peers over one WS):

- **Three unit kinds, one calling convention.** `python_runtime` (a background
  compute job), an AI backend (one inference turn), and `yaml_state` (durable
  memory) are all reached the same way: `send(<id>, {type, ...})`. A workflow step
  written as code and the same step written as an LLM call are **substitutable** —
  swap a `python_runtime.start` for an `ai.send` and the wiring is unchanged. This
  is the point: anywhere you'd hand-write a classifier / decision / transform, you
  can drop in an LLM call, and vice-versa.

- **Routines orchestrate the whole substrate, from either kernel.** Out-of-process
  code gets a kernel-mirroring **connector** that talks ONLY to its spawner, which
  holds the live kernel and relays (child → spawner → kernel; never a direct host
  dial — the no-bypass rule). A host `python_runtime` job's spawned code gets a
  `kernel` object (send/emit/reflect/watch/on_message over a socketpair); a browser
  view-agent's JS gets `fantastic` (the same surface over postMessage). Different
  wire, one protocol — exactly like `web_ws` and the pipe are two transports of the
  one envelope. So from EITHER side a routine reads memory anywhere, calls an AI,
  spawns a job, pushes to a panel — by id, regardless of which kernel owns the
  target. In-process `.tools` agents already hold the real `kernel`; the connector
  exists only to give *out-of-process* code the same reach.

- **Routing is emergent, not plumbed.** An AI worker is a streaming unit: it
  receives a call, thinks (calling agents as tools), and streams `token`/`done` on
  its own id. How its result reaches its addressee is the *model's* decision — the
  per-call prompt names who listens (possibly many), the system prompt carries the
  `send` signature, and a capable model routes its own output. No `reply_to`
  primitive; 1:N falls out for free. A recursion guard (`_call_stack`, refused
  before the lock) keeps AI→AI chains from deadlocking or running away.

- **Weak binding everywhere.** Backends and views are weak peers by id — an AI
  worker (or a PTY) runs headless with no view; a view attaches/detaches without
  touching the backend. Bind by id + duck-typed verbs, never by concrete type.

- **Capability emerges from self-description.** None of the above is special-cased:
  it falls out of `send`/`reflect` + each agent's readme. An LLM given only the
  readmes can weave the wiring itself — that's the test bar, not bespoke glue.

- **Validated — emergent memory with judgment.** Told ONLY that a `yaml_state`
  memory agent exists, an AI saves salient facts, withholds trivia (no excess
  writes), recalls them on a FRESH history-less turn, updates them, and prunes
  precisely — managing durable memory through `send` alone; the which-verb/when is
  derived, not coded. Proof: `integration_tests/memory/test_ai_memory_judgment.py`
  (asserts on the store, not prose). NOTE: today only the Swift FM backend
  auto-injects memory each turn; the Python backends reach it on demand by id.

## Run

```bash
uv sync                                              # install workspace + bundles editable
fantastic                                            # boot all + REPL (tty) + daemon (if web is persisted)
fantastic <id> <verb> [k=v ...]                      # one-shot RPC
fantastic reflect [<id>]                             # shorthand: <id> reflect (default: kernel)
fantastic fs_loader create_agent handler_module=web.tools port=8888    # persist web record (first time)
```

`main.py` bootstraps the substrate: `Kernel()` → `fs_loader.read_tree`
reads `.fantastic` → `kernel.load(records)`. The ROOT agent IS an
`fs_loader` (`id="fs_loader"`) — the persistence/hydration root that owns
`.fantastic/`; a fresh dir seeds it. Then argv goes to `dispatch_argv`
(`kernel/modes/`):
  - one-shot: `<id> <verb> [k=v]` / `reflect [<id>]`
  - long-running default: boots every persisted agent. If a `web`
    agent is among them, acquires lock + blocks (uvicorn lives via
    its asyncio task). If stdin is a tty, runs the REPL stdin loop.
    Composing neither → exit silently.

Web composition is **explicit** — no `--port` flag. To make `fantastic`
serve HTTP, persist a web agent first (one-shot create_agent or
REPL `add web port=N`). Next invocation boots it as a daemon.

The bootstrap wires the stdout renderer (Cli) when stdin is a tty —
ephemeral, never persisted.

**First contact (tty / PTY).** On a tty — a human, or an LLM dropped into a
`terminal_backend` PTY — the daemon greets whoever lands there (the tty twin of
the container's HTTP head page). The renderer (`cli`) is a **DUMB SINK** — it
prints what it is told and NEVER inspects the tree. The flow:
  - **`intro_booting`** (kernel → cli, before boot): identity
    (`runtime · env · version · root · pid`) + the **pull/push control-plane
    map** — one envelope `send(<id>,{type})`, PULL (REST / REPL), PUSH (WS
    watch/emit/state_subscribe), REACH compute/infer/memory/shell by id — and a
    pointer to the full map (`reflect readme=true`). Port-independent.
  - **boot-event convention:** each agent announces its OWN endpoints during
    boot. `web`, once it binds, sends cli a `say` with its listening URL (Rust:
    publishes a `say` state event the cli subscriber renders) — the producer
    owns the info; the sink never reaches in for it.
  - **`booted`** (kernel → cli, after the boot loop): the "all booted" close.
`longrun` fires `intro_booting`/`booted` only on a tty; non-tty (the container
daemon) keeps the plain `[kernel] up`. **Best-effort:** no renderer or a race is
fine — everything is in the intro map + `reflect readme=true`. The verbs/text
live in the `cli` bundle; the kernel stays decoupled (it sends verbs, never
imports the bundle). Rust mirrors it: the `fantastic-cli` binary prints
`fantastic_cli_bundle::intro_booting`/`booted`.

REPL example:

```
fantastic> add file
fantastic> add python_runtime
fantastic> @fs_loader list_agents
```

The view layer (canvas compositor, terminal/chat views, gl/html content
agents) is the TS FRONTEND kernel in the repo's top-level `ts/` package —
a federated peer over the WS bridge, NOT host agents (`*.ts` bundles, see
`ts/SERVE.md`). The host knows nothing of the `ts/` bundles; frontend
records persist back to host disk under `.fantastic/web/<session>/` via
the frontend's `proxy_loader`. See "Two kernels" in the root readme.

## Bundles (current set)

| bundle | role |
|---|---|
| `fs_loader` | the ROOT agent (`id="fs_loader"`) AND the persistence/hydration root: owns `.fantastic/`; answers `load_tree` / `persist_record` / `forget_record`; auto-persists the live tree by subscribing to the kernel state stream (debounced flush). A `root` meta lets a non-root instance serve a sub-namespace (the host-side of the frontend's `web/<session>/`). System verbs are native to Agent; the bootstrap wires Cli when `stdin.isatty()`. |
| `cli` | singleton child of root; renders token/done/say/error events to stdout |
| `web` | uvicorn HTTP host. Serves rendering only — `/` (root index from `templates/index.html`), `/<id>/` (agent's `render_html`), `/<id>/file/<path>` (read-verb file proxy), favicon. Call surfaces (WS, REST) live in sibling sub-agents and mount via the duck-typed `get_routes` verb. The TS frontend kernel brings its own typed WS bridge (`ts/`) — no transport script is injected here. |
| `web_ws` | WebSocket verb-invocation surface. Child of a `web` agent. Mounts `/<host_id>/ws` on its parent web's FastAPI app. Opt-in: `create_agent handler_module=web_ws.tools parent_id=<web>`. |
| `web_rest` | REST diagnostic surface. Child of a `web` agent. Mounts `POST /<self_id>/<target_id>` body=payload → kernel.send → JSON reply. Multiple instances coexist with different ids. Opt-in. |
| `file` | filesystem-as-agent (`read`, `write`, `list`, `delete`, `rename`, `mkdir`) |
| `scheduler` | recurring tasks; persistence routed through `file_agent_id` |
| `python_runtime` | async Python JOB spawner — `start` runs `python -u -c <code>` in the background (many in parallel), returns a `job_id` at once + streams `progress`/`job_done` events; `status`/`stop`/`interrupt`/`clear` by job_id over a RAM job table (`on_delete` kills the owner's jobs). No blocking run-and-wait. |
| `yaml_state` | durable YAML key-value memory agent; mount anywhere (`mode=mem|data`); write-through sidecar (`state.yaml`) it owns directly |
| `terminal_backend` | PTY shell backend (at `bundled_agents/terminal/`). VSCode-ported terminal robustness: streaming flow control (reader pauses past 100K unacked chars, resumes on the `ack` verb), incremental UTF-8 decode (no split-char `<?>` litter across `os.read` chunks), serialized full-buffer writes (bracketed-paste-safe), image-paste bridge (browser-clipboard image → `paste_image` → file saved + path typed into the PTY for a CLI like `claude`). The xterm view (`terminal_view`) lives in the TS frontend kernel (`ts/`). |
| `ai/ollama/ollama_backend` | local LLM agent (ollama); per-client chat threads, FIFO lock, menu cache |
| `ai/nvidia/nvidia_nim_backend` | NVIDIA NIM LLM agent (OpenAI-compatible); api_key sidecar via `file_agent_id`; rate-limit retry; same surface as ollama_backend |
| `ai/anthropic/anthropic_backend` (`anthropic_backend.tools`) | Claude LLM agent — Anthropic Messages API (default model `claude-opus-4-8`); key from `ANTHROPIC_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (env / `.env`); per-client chat threads, FIFO lock, native tool-calls, menu cache; same surface as ollama_backend |
| `bridge/kernel_bridge` | cross-kernel comms — **WS-only, asymmetric**. A bridge agent opens a WS to the remote's `web_ws` surface and ships raw `{type:"call", target, payload}` frames; the remote dispatches `kernel.send` exactly like a browser frame and replies over the same socket — **no peer bridge needed**. Transports: memory (test backbone) / ws / ssh+ws. Streaming via `watch_remote` (`{type:"watch", src}` out, `{type:"event"}` back, re-emitted on the bridge's own inbox). All transports are **weak binding** — addressed by URL + path only; no shared Python types with the remote kernel. Weak proxy: local→local stays direct. |
| `bridge/cloud_bridge` | cross-kernel comms through a **zero-trust relay** (`../fantastic_relay`, CONTRACT v1). Same verbs/frames as `kernel_bridge` (both ride the shared `bridge/bridge_core` engine), but BOTH peers dial OUT (WSS) to a relay that pairs them by `(tenant_id, rendezvous)` and forwards **opaque** frames; the peers run a peer↔peer **TLS 1.3 mutual-auth** handshake (stdlib `ssl` over a `MemoryBIO` — no hand-rolled crypto) with self-signed **Ed25519** device certs pinned to the account device list, and tunnel the bridge frames as **TLS application data**, so the relay sees only ciphertext + metadata (a forged route just fails the handshake; the device's `peer_id` key IS the cert key). `transport="cloud_bridge"`; control-plane token via a `token`/`token_provider` seam (not minted here). `bridge_core` is a library, not an agent (no entry point). |
| `local_runner` (`local_runner.tools`) | local sub-`fantastic` lifecycle — `start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status`/`get_webapp` for one project dir; truth read from the project's `.fantastic/lock.json` (PID) + its web agent record (port) |
| `ssh_runner` | remote `fantastic` lifecycle over SSH — start/stop/restart/status + local SSH tunnel for canvas iframing. Pure subprocess ssh; composes with `kernel_bridge` for messaging |

**View bundles live in the FRONTEND kernel (`ts/`), not here.** The
canvas compositor and its view/content agents are `*.ts` bundles that
run in the browser and persist back via `proxy_loader` (see "Two
kernels" in the root readme). The host holds only data/compute/transport
bundles.

Each bundle is a real Python package with its own `pyproject.toml`,
declaring `[project.entry-points."fantastic.bundles"]`. `fantastic`
discovers them uniformly via `importlib.metadata.entry_points` —
works for in-tree workspace members AND `pip install` third-party
plugins (drop in `installed_agents/`).

Add a bundle by dropping its package under `bundled_agents/` (or
`installed_agents/`) and running `uv sync`; its entry point is scanned at
the next process start.

## Universal patterns

- **`reflect`** — every agent answers `{type:"reflect"}` returning the
  ADDRESSED agent uniformly: `{id, sentence, display_name, description?,
  verbs:{name:doc}, emits:{type:shape}, ...flat state}`. Root is NOT
  special (no `primer`). Compose the reply with flags:
  `tree=all|ids|none` (default `all` — nested distilled subtree; `ids` =
  flat descendant-id index), `bundles=all|ids|none` (default `none` —
  the installable-bundle catalog), `readme=true` (attach the agent's
  readme.md). Verb signatures live in
  docstrings; `reflect` derives them. Discovery is one round-trip;
  transport/wire docs live in the root readme (`reflect readme=true`).
  The **ROOT** reflect additionally carries `runtime` — a stable lowercase
  enum (`python` | `rust` | `swift` | `ts`) naming the kernel's runtime, so
  a client gates runtime-specific UI from one round-trip. Same field name +
  values across all four runtimes; injected uniformly in
  `_apply_reflect_flags` (root only). Differs by runtime BY DESIGN (like the
  root id), so cross-runtime parity asserts the per-runtime value, not equality.
  The root reflect ALSO carries two deployment-context fields, in key order
  `runtime → env → version`: `env` (read from `$FANTASTIC_ENV`, default
  `"host"`; the container image bakes `"container"`) tells a client WHERE the
  kernel runs — e.g. `env:"container"` means `shutdown_kernel` stops + (under
  `--rm`) removes a whole container, not just a process — and `version` (read
  from `$FANTASTIC_VERSION`, default `null`; the image bakes the release tag)
  names the build. Both are RUN-scoped (read inline at root reflect, never
  persisted to the portable `.fantastic` workdir, which can move host↔container)
  and root-only like `runtime`. The host runtimes read the envs; the browser
  `ts` kernel has no OS env, so it is always `env:"host"`, `version:null`.
- **`render_html`** — duck-typed presentation. Any agent returning
  `{html:str}` from `render_html` can be rendered by a view. This is now
  a FRONTEND pattern (a `*.ts` content agent holds the body in its
  record); the host web still exposes a generic `/<id>/` route but ships no host
  implementer. Bodies reach the kernel via the frontend's own typed WS
  bridge (`ts/`) — no transport script injected.
- **`get_webapp`** — duck-typed UI discovery. The TS canvas compositor
  iframes any agent that answers `get_webapp` with `{url,
  default_width, default_height, title}`.
- **`reload_html`** — universal page reload. The TS frontend kernel
  subscribes to it; any agent that emits `{type:"reload_html"}` on its
  own inbox triggers a reload of the connected view. `set_html` and the
  canvas frame ⟳ button both go through it.
- **`file_agent_id`** — bundles that need persistence (ollama_backend,
  scheduler) carry an `file_agent_id` on
  their record. Failfast if unset (no implicit fallback).
- **`delete_lock: true`** on a record refuses delete. The root's
  `delete_agent` returns `{error, locked:true, id}` so LLM callers
  can detect it programmatically. Clear via `update_agent`.
- **`on_delete` cascade hook** — substrate calls `await
  agent.on_delete()` depth-first during cascade-delete BEFORE
  detaching the record from `kernel.agents` and the parent's
  `_children`. It tears down PROCESS state only: if the agent's
  `handler_module` exposes `async def on_delete(agent)`, invoke it.
  DISK cleanup is NOT here — the `removed` state event drives a loader
  to rmtree the dir. Bundles port teardown into this function —
  `terminal_backend.on_delete` closes the PTY, `web.on_delete` drains
  uvicorn, `kernel_bridge.on_delete` cancels the read loop + tunnel,
  runner bundles call their own `_stop`.
- **`ephemeral` class flag** — `class Cli(Agent): ephemeral = True`
  means a loader skips it entirely (never written to disk; `save()`
  omits it). Composition is per-process; reboots compose afresh based
  on mode. Use for stateless renderers / debuggers / dispatchers.
- **State-event `sender` + `summary`** — every `send`/`emit` state
  event carries `sender` (the dispatching agent's id, set via a
  task-local contextvar around handler dispatch; the host's WS/REST
  surface tags external traffic with the surface agent's own id) and
  `summary` (a JSON-stringified, bytes-stripped, max-160-char view
  of the payload). A frontend telemetry view uses both to draw
  sender→receiver wires + a last-N message log.
- **Iframe URLs — never hardcode a host** — agents that return a URL
  from `get_webapp` use a path-relative form (`/<agent_id>/`) so the
  iframe inherits the canvas's `host:port` automatically. Wrappers
  that embed an **external** HTTP service on a different port (the
  vscode_fantastic bundle wraps `code serve-web`; future Jupyter /
  media-server / remote-app bundles will look similar) must build
  the iframe URL with `window.location.hostname`, not the host
  serve-web bound to. Browsers treat `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as
  different sites (Safari especially partitions storage / cookies /
  SAB across them), and a cross-site top↔iframe relationship trips
  workbench-style apps. Hostname-matching keeps top-doc + iframe
  same-site without exposing the bind on a public interface, and
  composes naturally with the `ssh_runner` tunnel (the tunnel
  terminates on the user's localhost, so the hostname stays
  consistent).

## Self-bootstrap (for code agents)

The substrate is self-describing through the root readme — which a code
agent gets either by reading `.fantastic/readme.md` off disk (no process,
no socket needed) or with one reflect:

Open `ws://host/<any-agent>/ws` and send
`{"type":"call","target":"kernel","payload":{"type":"reflect","readme":true,"bundles":"all"},"id":"1"}`.
The reply carries:

- `readme` — the root readme: every transport (in_process / in_prompt /
  cli / ws / rest / binary-frame), the reflect surface, the `kernel`
  alias, the two-kernel (host + frontend) model, and the
  `.fantastic/lock.json` daemon rule. This is where transport/wire docs
  live now (they left the reflect JSON).
- `tree` — the live agent tree (default `all`; `tree:"ids"` for a cheap
  id index).
- `bundles` — with `bundles:"all"`, every installable bundle (what you
  can `create_agent` from); `bundles:"ids"` for names only.

Per-agent reflect carries `verbs: {name: doc-line}` so an LLM caller can
compose any `payload` from the docstring without source diving. "If you
find yourself reading kernel/ to discover a transport URL, that's a
regression — it belongs in the root readme."

## Tests

- **Unit** — `pytest -n auto` (`pytest-xdist`). 420+ tests, parallel,
  in-process. Each bundle's tests live in `bundled_agents/<bundle>/tests/`;
  kernel-level tests live in `tests/`. `conftest.py` at root exposes
  `kernel`, `seeded_kernel`, `file_agent` fixtures (the root is an
  `fs_loader`); `_testkit.py` adds `boot_root` / `persist` for disk tests.
- **Selftests** — scope-tagged markdown specs. AI agents read them,
  drive the system at the user-facing surface (CLI, HTTP, WS, PTY,
  browser), and fill summary tables. Index + protocol at root
  `selftest.md`. Each bundle owns one.

## Pre-push checks

```bash
uvx ruff check kernel/ main.py bundled_agents/ tests/
uvx ruff format --check kernel/ main.py bundled_agents/ tests/
uv run pytest -n auto
```

## Commits & pushes — ASK FIRST

**Do NOT `git commit` or `git push` unless the user explicitly asks
for it.** No "I'll just commit this since the work is done" — wait
for the word.

OK to do without asking: edit files, run `pytest`, run `ruff`,
create a branch when the user has named it, show diffs (`git diff
--cached`, `git status`). Anything that touches refs or origin
needs explicit consent: commit, amend, push, force-push, branch
delete, tag, rebase, reset --hard.

If you think work should be committed, _say so_ and wait. The cost
of asking once is low; the cost of an unwanted commit (lost diff
review, force-push surprise, polluted history) is high.

## Conventions

- All async (`asyncio` throughout). `pytest-asyncio` with
  `asyncio_mode = "auto"`.
- Agent IDs: `{bundle}_{hex6}` (e.g. `ollama_backend_b04b35`).
  Singletons use the bundle name (`fs_loader`, `cli`).
- Every bundle's `tools.py` defines:
  - per-verb `async def _<name>(id, payload, kernel)` with a
    one-line docstring (auto-fed into reflect's `verbs` dict).
  - `VERBS = {"<name>": _<name>, ...}` dispatch table.
  - `async def handler(id, payload, kernel)` 4-line dispatcher.
- Records in `.fantastic/agents/<id>/agent.json` carry only metadata.
  Process-memory state (PTY child, uvicorn server, in-flight tasks)
  is per-process and visible only to the kernel that owns it —
  reflect from the live `serve` to see it, NOT via a fresh
  `fantastic call` (which spawns a separate kernel).

## Storage policy

- Project code lives in version-controlled files in this repo or
  user dirs. **`.fantastic/` is runtime state only** — agent.json
  records, per-agent sidecars (chat_<client>.json,
  schedules.json, history.jsonl), `lock.json`, `readme.md`.
  Wipe-and-rebuild safe.
- Use the `file` agent (rooted at any path) for HTTP-served content:
  `<img src="/<file_id>/file/imgs/foo.png">` works in any html view.

## Path conventions

- All paths relative when invoked via `fantastic call` (cwd = project
  dir).
- The file agent's path-safety refuses anything escaping its `root`.
- `fantastic` writes `.fantastic/lock.json` with `{pid, port}`;
  a second serve in the same dir refuses with a clear error and stale
  locks (dead pid) get overwritten.

## What's NOT here (yet)

These existed in an older codebase iteration; deferred, replaced, or moved:

- `core` — cut. The root IS the `fs_loader` agent now; there's no
  separate userland-orchestrator class.
- `canvas_backend` / `html_agent` / `gl_agent` — the spatial UI + view/
  content agents are no longer HOST bundles; they moved to the FRONTEND
  kernel (`ts/`, `*.ts`). See "Two kernels".
- `telemetry_pane` — discarded entirely (a throwaway test agent; gone
  from every runtime, not moved).
- `openai` AI bundle — not shipped (`ollama` / `anthropic` /
  `nvidia_nim` backends ship). Pattern: mirror `ollama_backend`.
  Recoverable from git history.
- `register_template` / `list_templates` — replaced by per-agent
  reflect (single source of truth).
- `content_alias_file` registry — replaced by the URL convention
  `/<file_id>/file/<path>`.
- agent `memory_long.jsonl` append-only memory — replaceable by the
  `file` agent + path convention.
