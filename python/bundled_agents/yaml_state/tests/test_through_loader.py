"""The through-loader memory path, end-to-end, with NO model — the deterministic twin
of the LLM-discovery test (integration_tests/memory/test_ai_memory_discovery.py).

An operator/LLM does exactly this: wire the `.fantastic` store ONCE (the loader finds
it), create a yaml_state memory agent (NOTHING else — no per-agent wiring), set a fact,
read it back. It lands on disk THROUGH the loader, next to the agent's own record.
No `file_bridge_id` anywhere on the memory agent."""
