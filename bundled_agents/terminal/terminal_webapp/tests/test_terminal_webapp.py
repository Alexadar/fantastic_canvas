In the recursive Agent model, terminal_webapp owns its terminal_backend
as a structural child. `_boot` (fired automatically on create_agent)
spawns the backend idempotently and writes its id into the webapp's
`upstream_id` field. Subsequent reboots find the existing child via
`_load_children` and skip the creation.
