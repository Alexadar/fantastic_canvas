# Aisixteen Fantastic

*A medium that unifies humans and AIs into a single workspace.*
Repo codename: `fantastic-canvas` — the open-core kernels + browser frontend.

Recursive `Agent` nodes, one primitive (`send`), compile-time-linked
bundles. Every agent answers `{"type":"reflect"}` — the universal
discovery verb. No client library: the protocol IS the API. The on-disk
`.fantastic/` workdir format is part of the product.

Capabilities **emerge from that self-description**: given only the readmes, an
AI weaves the wiring itself — e.g. told merely that a `yaml_state` memory agent
exists, it manages durable memory with judgment (saves salient facts, recalls
them on a fresh turn, prunes the rest), entirely through `send`. Proof:
[`integration_tests/memory/`](integration_tests/memory/test_ai_memory_judgment.py).

## Run it now — one container, driven by an AI

The whole thing ships as **one OCI image** (multi-arch, podman **and** docker):

| tag | what |
|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/alexadar/fantastic:latest` | newest — `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` in one manifest; the registry auto-serves your arch on pull |
| `ghcr.io/alexadar/fantastic:v0.3.0` | a pinned version (same multi-arch manifest) |

**Pull, run, open the port — that's the whole thing:**

```sh
podman run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8088:8088 -v "$PWD":/work \
  ghcr.io/alexadar/fantastic:latest          # docker is identical
```

Then **open `http://127.0.0.1:8088/`** → a self-describing **head page**: every
readme (how it works *and* how to drive it) rendered right there on the port. The
same self-description, machine-readable, in one call:

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8088/rest/kernel \
  -d '{"type":"reflect","readme":true,"bundles":"all"}'
```

**The intended way to use it — give an AI this URL.** It pulls + runs the image,
reads `reflect` over `web_ws` (`/web/ws`) / `rest` (`POST /rest/<target>`) — **no
client library, the protocol IS the API** — and then **builds** by composing
agents (`create_agent` + wiring them with `send`) against the folder you mounted
at **`/work`** (the `file` / `terminal` / `python_runtime` agents act on it). Hand
it a [recipe](container/recipes.md) and it assembles a working app — capability
emerges from self-description, no bespoke glue. Full run contract + 7 recipes:
[`container/README.md`](container/README.md) · [`container/recipes.md`](container/recipes.md).

## Four runtimes, one workdir

Four kernels share the same `send`/`reflect` protocol and wire format:
three interchangeable **hosts** (python, swift, rust) plus the browser
**frontend** (ts). The three hosts share one on-disk `.fantastic/` workdir
— **one host active per workdir at a time** (the `lock.json` PID guard).
The ts frontend is the fourth kernel: it runs in the browser, federates to
whichever host is up over the WS bridge, and any host serves it generically
(a `file` agent over `ts/dist`) while knowing nothing about it.

```
fantastic_canvas/
├── python/   reference implementation — uvicorn + FastAPI
├── swift/    production runtime for Apple — Network.framework + URLSession
├── rust/     server / CLI host runtime — axum + tokio (pure Rust)
└── ts/       browser frontend kernel — views as agents, served over the bridge
```

- **Python** (`python/`) — **the canonical reference**. When
  implementations disagree, Python is correct. The other runtimes
  mirror its wire shape, on-disk format, and verb payloads. The
  protocol surface (HTTP routes, WS frames, system verbs, reflect
  contract, on-disk layout) is documented inside Python's
  [`CLAUDE.md`](python/CLAUDE.md); no separate protocol spec exists.
  Run with `cd python && uv sync && uv run fantastic`. See
  [`python/README.md`](python/README.md).
- **Swift** (`swift/`) — same behavior, fits inside a sandboxed iOS /
  iPadOS / visionOS app and runs unsandboxed on macOS Pro. Drift from
  Python's wire/on-disk/verb shape is a bug; the conformance test at
  [`swift/Tests/FantasticParityTests`](swift/Tests/FantasticParityTests)
  spawns a peer kernel and byte-diffs replies as the mechanical drift
  detector. Run with `cd swift && swift run fantastic`. See
  [`swift/README.md`](swift/README.md).
- **Rust** (`rust/`) — a pure-Rust host kernel for servers and the CLI
  (the embedded slice has no subprocess deps). It is **not** linked into
  the Apple app; it's a peer host and the cross-runtime bridge partner.
  Run with `cd rust && cargo run`. See [`rust/README.md`](rust/README.md).
- **TS** (`ts/`) — the browser **frontend** kernel: the view layer
  (canvas, `html_agent`, `gl_agent`, the `ai` + `terminal` views) as
  agents in their own kernel, federated to a host over the WS bridge and
  persisted back to the host's disk opaquely. Dev build: `cd ts && npm run
  build` → `ts/dist/`. Sovereign artifact: `cd ts && sh scripts/pack.sh`
  → `ts/dist/js_kernel.zip` (one inlined bundle, no npm at serve time).
  See [`ts/readme.md`](ts/readme.md) and [`ts/SERVE.md`](ts/SERVE.md).

### The frontend is decoupled

The host kernels render no UI of their own. The browser frontend lives
in `ts/` (its own kernel — views are agents: `canvas`, `html_agent`,
`gl_agent`, the `ai` and `terminal` views) and is served by **any** host
through a generic `file` agent rooted at the built `ts/dist`. The host
never imports, names, or knows about the frontend (weak binding); it
persists frontend records opaquely and weak-loads past them. The same
recipe serves any view package. The sovereign distribution artifact is
`ts/dist/js_kernel.zip` (`cd ts && sh scripts/pack.sh`): one inlined
`bundle.min.js` + `readme.md` + map, pulled on demand and served via a
`file` agent — no import map, no CSS link (vendors + CSS are inlined).
See [`ts/readme.md`](ts/readme.md) and [`ts/SERVE.md`](ts/SERVE.md).

## One runtime active per workdir

**One host runtime is active per workdir at a time.** The
`.fantastic/lock.json` PID guard enforces it — no concurrent mode for a
single dir. Switching is a reboot: stop one daemon, start another
against the same dir. (Distinct kernels *do* talk across the WS
`kernel_bridge` — that's separate, explicit wiring, not shared-dir
concurrency.)

**Weak loading** keeps switching safe. If a persisted agent's
`handler_module` isn't installed in the active runtime, the kernel logs
one line to stderr and skips that agent on boot — same byte shape across
all kernels so CI and selftests can grep it:

    [kernel] skipping agent <id>: bundle <module> not installed in this runtime

The record stays on disk untouched. Reboot under a runtime that has the
bundle and the agent rehydrates intact. (This is exactly how a host that
ships no view bundles still round-trips a `ts/` frontend record on disk.)

## Apple integration

The Swift app at
[`Alexadar/fantastic_app`](https://github.com/Alexadar/fantastic_app)
links the **Swift** kernel directly as a SwiftPM dependency — no UniFFI,
no XCFramework, no Rust on the device:

- **FantasticPro** (macOS, unsandboxed) — full bundle set including
  PTY / subprocess / `python_runtime` / `ssh_runner`. Macros and
  in-process Cocoa interop available because the kernel runs as
  Swift in the app's address space.
- **FantasticLite** (macOS + iOS + iPadOS + visionOS, App Store
  sandboxed) — subprocess / PTY bundles are compile-time excluded
  via `#if os(macOS)` gates inside `FantasticTerminalBackend` and
  `FantasticSshRunner`, so the slice is App Sandbox compliant.
  Binds a loopback `127.0.0.1:0` server the existing `WKWebView`
  points at; zero changes to canvas frontend code.

The app consumes the Swift kernel through two umbrella SPM products
(`FantasticKernelEmbedded` / `FantasticKernelFull`) that
`@_exported import` the kernel modules under a stable name. See
[`swift/README.md`](swift/README.md) for the consumption story and the
bundle scoreboard.

## Contributing

All host runtimes share the wire contract — any change that affects the
HTTP/WS protocol, the `.fantastic/` on-disk format, or the reflect
contract needs to land in every host. Lint + test commands per runtime
are in the respective READMEs.

Commits and pushes require explicit consent per project convention.
