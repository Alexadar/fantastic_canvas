//! Transport abstraction for the kernel_bridge.
//!
//! Every transport exposes the same triple — `send_frame`,
//! `recv_frame`, `close` — so the bridge's read-loop is one piece
//! of code regardless of how bytes move between kernels. Three
//! implementations ship today:
//!
//! - [`memory`] — in-process pair, used for unit tests + the
//!   `inject_pair` test seam. No I/O, deterministic.
//! - [`ws`] — `tokio-tungstenite` client against a remote
//!   `fantastic-web` WebSocket surface.
//! - [`http`] — `reqwest` POST against a remote `web_rest`
//!   surface. Asymmetric (no server push); `recv_frame` reads off
//!   a self-populated queue that `send_frame` fills with the HTTP
//!   response synchronously.
//!
//! Frame shape on the wire (mirrors Python's kernel_bridge):
//!
//! ```text
//! outbound  {type:"call",  target:peer_id,
//!            payload:{type:"forward", target, payload, corr_id},
//!            id:corr_id}
//! inbound   {type:"call",  ...}  — peer-originated, read loop dispatches via kernel.send
//! inbound   {type:"reply", id, data}
//! inbound   {type:"error", id, error}
//! ```
