# Fantastic E2E — the heavy, rarely-run validation

This is the **most expensive** test layer in the repo. It is **NOT** part of
`pytest`, `npm test`, or the normal `node --test` runs — those stay fast and free.
This one:

- spends **real Anthropic tokens** (live `claude-opus-4-8` inference turns), and
- **spawns a fresh "builder" agent** that wires the system **from zero** using only
  `curl` + the system's own readmes (no source, no kernel tools),

so it takes **minutes, not seconds, and costs money**. Run it **rarely** — before a
release, or after touching the workflow substrate (the `python_runtime` connector,
the AI backends, the scheduler, `ai_view`, or any of the readmes those depend on).

## Why it exists — two things the cheap tests can't prove

The unit + browser integration tests prove the substrate **mechanically works**, but
they **hard-code the wiring** (the setup is `bootHost`, the tree is seeded by hand,
the `fantastic.send(...)`/`watch` calls are written by us). They answer *"given the
correct wiring, does it behave?"* — not *"can an LLM build it?"*. This layer closes
both gaps:

1. **Live integration** — the real scheduler → AI → panel chain, AI-drives-UI by
   tool-call, AI → python, AI → AI — against a live model, end-to-end in a browser.
2. **Emergence from zero** — a spawned, readme-only agent discovers the agents via
   `reflect` and **composes the whole workflow itself**, proving the
   self-description is sufficient for capability to *emerge* (the north-star).

## Prerequisites

- `cd python && uv sync` (the `fantastic` venv).
- `cd ts && npm run build` (the `ts/dist` frontend the browser loads).
- System **Chrome** (headless) — see `../_chrome.ts`.
- **`ANTHROPIC_KEY`** (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) in the repo `.env`.

If any are missing the runner reports it and skips the affected phase — it never
hangs or silently "passes".

## How to run

It is **agent-driven** — an operating agent (Claude Code) executes `RUN.md`, because
Phase 2 spawns a sub-agent (a plain script can't). From a session, say:

> run the e2e suite (integration_tests/py_ts/e2e/RUN.md)

The agent boots a bare host with `boot_bare_host.sh`, runs the live browser tests,
spawns the builder agent with the prompt in `RUN.md`, verifies the result with
`verify_panel.ts`, fills the results table, and tears the host down.

## Files

- `RUN.md` — the runbook the agent follows (phases, the exact builder prompt,
  acceptance criteria, results table).
- `boot_bare_host.sh` — boots a BARE substrate daemon (web + web_ws + web_rest +
  web_loader + a seeded `canvas` + the served frontend; **no** workflow agents).
- `verify_panel.ts` — headless-Chrome check that a canvas panel shows the answer.
- `teardown_host.sh` — kill the daemon + remove its temp dir.
