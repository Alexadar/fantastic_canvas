# Fantastic integration tests

Cross-runtime tests that spawn real `fantastic` kernels as subprocesses,
pair them via the `kernel_bridge` bundle, and exercise the canonical
verb surface (send / reflect / streams) across the wire.

These are **integration** tests — heavyweight, slow, real network I/O.
They live outside the per-runtime unit-test trees on purpose. Each
test launches one or more `fantastic` processes, waits for them to
bind their HTTP/WS surfaces, configures bridges, and verifies the
wire-level interop end-to-end.

**Python is the orchestrator** because it's the fastest iteration loop
(no recompile per change). The kernels under test can be any
combination of `python/.venv/bin/fantastic` and
`swift/.build/{debug,release}/fantastic`.

The **`py_ts/`** subsuite is the exception: it's **node-driven** (`node --test`
+ a headless Chrome), because the TS frontend kernel only runs in a browser.
Same goal — interop *between* kernels — different driver. See `py_ts/README.md`.

## Layout

```
integration_tests/
  pyproject.toml      uv-managed; pytest + websockets + httpx
  conftest.py         shared fixtures: free_port, parity_tmp,
                      python/swift/rust _binary + _kernel spawn factories
  helpers/
    kernel_proc.py    subprocess wrapper for fantastic kernels
    seeding.py        one-shot CLI seeding (web / web_ws / web_rest /
                      bridge_ws) + root_id() (resolve a kernel's literal root)
                      + zip helpers: frontend_zip(), pull_member_from_zip(),
                      read_member_text(), expected_bundle_sha() (used by
                      decoupling/test_serve_frontend.py to direct-pull the
                      frontend artifact without a full unzip)
    streaming.py      assert_watch_remote_streams — the shared watch_remote driver
    ws.py             minimal WS client: ws_call, ws_emit, ws_session
  bridge/             cross-runtime kernel_bridge tests (WS-only) — the
                      python/swift/rust forward + watch_remote matrix
  decoupling/         decoupling guards — part-1 (bundle catalog drops the
                      view bundles; a host serves the ts/ frontend generically)
                      + part-3 (readme-contract lint: host readmes describe
                      capability only, never client tech)
  web/                host HTTP surface tests (web_rest)
  py_ts/              Python<->TS tests (node-driven, real browser) + the
                      heavy e2e emergence layer — see py_ts/README.md
  rust_ts/ swift_ts/  browser-e2e scaffolds for the rust/swift hosts (not yet
                      wired — see their README.md)
  tmp/                per-run scratch workdirs (gitignored)
```

## Setup

```bash
cd integration_tests
uv sync
```

Path discovery for the kernel binaries is automatic; the conftest
looks for:

  Python kernel: `python/.venv/bin/fantastic` (run `cd ../python &&
  uv sync` once to install)

  Swift kernel:  `swift/.build/debug/fantastic` (run `cd ../swift &&
  swift build` to compile)

  Rust kernel:   `rust/target/{release,debug}/fantastic` (run `cd
  ../rust && cargo build` to compile; release is preferred when both
  exist, picked by mtime)

A test is skipped (not failed) when its required kernel binary
isn't built yet.

## Running

```bash
cd integration_tests
uv run pytest                                         # everything
uv run pytest bridge/                                 # one subsuite (the bridge matrix)
uv run pytest bridge/test_bridge_python_python_ws.py  # one file
uv run pytest decoupling/                             # the decoupling guards
uv run pytest -k swift                                # filter by name
uv run pytest -s                                      # streamed stdout (verbose)
```

### Target: local binaries (default) or the container

The SAME tests run against either locally-built kernel binaries or the universal
container image, selected by `FANTASTIC_TARGET` (no test changes — the spawn
fixtures + seeding route through a `Launcher`, see `helpers/launcher.py`):

```bash
uv run pytest                                         # FANTASTIC_TARGET=local (default)
FANTASTIC_TARGET=container uv run pytest web/         # run against the container image
FANTASTIC_IMAGE=fantastic:latest FANTASTIC_TARGET=container uv run pytest web/   # override tag
```

Container target notes:
- Needs the image built (`sh container/build.sh`) and podman/docker present;
  tests skip cleanly otherwise. The image must be the **host arch** (native) —
  a cross-arch image runs under emulation and is slow.
- Seeding one-shots run **inside** the container too (a rootless container's uid
  can't write a host-seeded `.fantastic/`), and the daemon runs with
  `FANTASTIC_HEAD=off` so `/` is the dynamic readiness signal.
- **Swift** has no Linux container (Network.framework HTTP) → swift tests skip
  under `container`.
- **Bridge across containers — each container is a unit at `host:port`, NO shared
  network.** The kernel_bridge is weak-binding by URL, so it just dials the peer's
  PUBLISHED address:
  - **same host:** publish the peer on all interfaces (`-p port:port`) and dial it
    via the built-in host gateway `host.containers.internal:port` — the host
    forwards to it. (`127.0.0.1` is wrong here: inside a container it's that
    container's own loopback, not the host.)
  - **another machine:** dial `ws://<machine-ip>:<port>/<peer>/ws` directly, or use
    the `ssh+ws` bridge transport to tunnel with no exposed port.
  - Proven by `bridge/test_bridge_container_to_container.py` (container-only;
    `publish_all=True` + `CONTAINER_PEER_HOST`). The existing python↔python bridge
    matrix runs against the `local` target.

## What's tested

All bridge transport is **WS-only, asymmetric**: the client bridge
opens a WS to the server's `web_ws` surface and ships raw
`{type:"call", target, payload}` frames — no peer bridge on the
server side. The server must be up before the client boots (the WS
connects eagerly), so tests spawn the server kernel first.

| test | runtimes paired | verb surface |
|---|---|---|
| `test_bridge_python_python_ws.py` | Python ↔ Python | `forward(reflect)` + `forward(list_agents)` |
| `test_bridge_swift_python_ws.py`  | Swift → Python  | `forward(reflect)` (Swift client, Python server) |
| `test_bridge_python_swift_ws.py`  | Python → Swift  | `forward(reflect)` (Python client, Swift server) |
| `test_bridge_swift_swift_ws.py`   | Swift → Swift   | `forward(reflect)` (closest proxy for the Apple app) |
| `test_bridge_rust_matrix_ws.py`   | rust→rust · rust→python · python→rust · rust→swift · swift→rust | `forward(reflect)` across the whole Rust matrix + rust↔rust `watch_remote` stream |
| `test_bridge_stream_python_python_ws.py` | Python ↔ Python | `watch_remote` → `event` re-emit streaming |
| `test_bridge_stream_python_swift_ws.py`  | Python → Swift  | `watch_remote` → `event` re-emit streaming |
| `test_bridge_stream_swift_python_ws.py`  | Swift → Python  | `watch_remote` → `event` re-emit streaming |
| `test_bridge_stream_swift_swift_ws.py`   | Swift ↔ Swift   | `watch_remote` → `event` re-emit streaming |

Each test runs against fresh workdirs under `tmp/<test-name>/<uuid>/`.
On failure the workdir is preserved for inspection (look for `agent.json`
state + `lock.json` to see what the kernel had).

## Adding a test

1. Drop a `test_*.py` in the matching subfolder (`bridge/`, `decoupling/`,
   `web/`, or a new topical one). The root `conftest.py` + `helpers/`
   resolve from any depth (conftest puts `integration_tests/` on `sys.path`).
2. Use the `python_kernel` / `swift_kernel` / `rust_kernel` fixtures to spawn
   instances (spawn the **server** first — the client bridge connects eagerly).
3. Seed with `helpers.seeding`: `seed_web` + `seed_web_ws` (Python
   server) and `seed_bridge_ws(..., peer_id=<root>, peer_port=<server>)`
   on the client. Don't hardcode `peer_id` — root ids differ by runtime
   (`fs_loader` for python, `core` for rust/swift), so resolve the
   server's literal root with `root_id(server_binary, server_workdir)`.
   Then call `kernel.call("bridge", "boot")` once as an idempotent
   connect guard.
4. Make assertions about the wire shape; on drift, the test fails
   loudly with the divergent JSON included.

Drift caught by these tests is **definitionally a bug in the non-Python
runtime** — Python is the canonical reference for the Fantastic protocol.

## Why not in `python/tests` or `swift/Tests`?

- `python/tests/` are in-process unit tests against the Python kernel
  alone — no subprocess, no cross-runtime.
- `swift/Tests/` are in-process unit tests against the Swift kernel
  alone — no subprocess, no cross-runtime.
- These are different: they exercise the **interop surface between
  kernels**, which lives in neither tree.
