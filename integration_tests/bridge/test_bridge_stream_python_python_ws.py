"""Bridge streaming integration test — Python client ↔ Python server over WS.

Exercises the `watch_remote` path end-to-end with two Python kernels:

  1. A.bridge connects to B's web_ws (asymmetric — no bridge agent on B).
  2. A.bridge.watch_remote(target=server_root) → sends {type:"watch",
     src:<server_root>} to B. B's web_ws registers kernel.watch(<server_root>, ...).
     `server_root` is B's LITERAL root id, resolved at test time via
     root_id(python_binary, workdir_b) — for Python this is "kernel_state".
     watch/emit do LITERAL id lookups; the "kernel" dispatch alias does NOT work here.
  3. An emit on B's root ({type:"emit", target:<server_root>, payload:{...}})
     fans out to B's watcher → B sends {type:"event", payload} back
     over the bridge WS.
  4. A.bridge's read loop re-emits payload on its OWN inbox.
  5. A test client watching A.bridge's inbox sees the event.

The probe payload carries a unique nonce so we can distinguish it
from boot/handshake noise (bridge_up, the watch_remote call's own fanout).

This file is the CANONICAL reference for literal-root discipline:
  - seed_bridge_ws(peer_id=server_root) — peer WS path uses the literal root
  - assert_watch_remote_streams(server_root=server_root) — watch/emit use literal root
  - root_id() is called once and reused, never hardcoded as "core" or "kernel_state"
