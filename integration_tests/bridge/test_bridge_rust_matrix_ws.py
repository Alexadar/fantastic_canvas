"""Bridge integration — Rust in the cross-runtime matrix (WS-only).

Proves that the rust `kernel_bridge` agent interoperates correctly across all
runtime pairs. Five forward/reflect test cases cover every directed edge where
rust is involved:

  rust→rust · rust→python · python→rust · rust→swift · swift→rust

Plus one rust↔rust `watch_remote` streaming test.

Setup per forward test: client kernel gets web + web_ws + bridge seeds; server
kernel gets web + web_ws. Server spawns first (the bridge connects eagerly on
boot), then `boot` is an idempotent connect guard.

Root-id note: `_forward_reflect` dispatches via peer_id='kernel' and
target='kernel' — the `kernel` alias resolves to the real root on any runtime
(kernel_state for Python, core for rust/swift), so no forward test hardcodes a
runtime-specific root id.

The stream test uses peer_id='core' literally because watch/emit do a literal
id lookup (no alias), and both sides are rust kernels whose root id is 'core'.
`assert_watch_remote_streams` defaults server_root='core', which is correct here.
