"""Workdir seeding for fantastic kernels — via one-shot CLI calls.

Both Python and Swift CLIs support `fantastic <id> <verb> [k=v ...]`
one-shot RPC against the workdir. We use that to create agents, so
the on-disk format is whatever the canonical runtime writes (nested
`agents/<id>/agents/<child>/agent.json` per Python). This avoids
hand-rolling JSON files that might diverge from the canonical shape.

The trade-off: each seed step is a subprocess invocation (~50-200 ms
overhead per call). For tests with a handful of agents that's fine.

If a test needs a hot-path bulk seed (10+ agents), bypass this and
use direct file writes — but then check the layout matches
`python/kernel/_agent.py:_load_children` exactly.
