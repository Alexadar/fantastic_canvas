"""LIVE Context-Protocol validation — one interchangeable backend harness over the two
strategies (`compact` · `truncate`), plus a model-REACTION test.

This is the KEY deliverable of the context work: prove END-TO-END, against a REAL LLM, that

  1. overflow actually FIRES once the conversation outgrows the budget (context_status),
  2. the model KEEPS answering after projection — i.e. the projected message list (incl.
     the prepended context-notice) is a shape the real backend accepts (the tool-pairing
     invariant matters most on nvidia / OpenAI-wire, which rejects an orphaned `role:tool`),
  3. the DURABLE record stays WHOLE — every driven turn is still in the mounted chat
     yaml_state (a strategy projects the MODEL CONTEXT, it never trims the store), and
  4. the model RE-ACTS to a compaction notice — pages a dropped fact back via `recall` or
     persists it to its memory agent (`test_model_reacts_to_compaction_notice`). This is
     the 'probably → measured' close: the reaction is read off `context_status.last_reaction`.

The exact summarized/dropped arithmetic is already pinned by the deterministic unit tests
(`ai_core/tests/test_context.py`); here we assert the live, structured truth surfaces
(`context_status` + `history` + the `mem` store), never the model's prose (except the final
codename recall).

Backend-configurable — the SAME test runs on either backend by one env switch:

    FANTASTIC_TEST_BACKEND = ollama (default, local/free) | nvidia (NVAPI, paid)
    FANTASTIC_TEST_MODEL    = backend-specific model id
    FANTASTIC_CTX_WINDOW    = the forced small window (default 3000)
    FANTASTIC_CTX_TURNS     = how many chunky turns to drive (default 10)

    cd integration_tests && uv run pytest context/test_ai_context_strategy.py -s
    FANTASTIC_TEST_BACKEND=nvidia uv run pytest context/test_ai_context_strategy.py -s

Anthropic is intentionally NOT a backend here (out of scope for this validation).
