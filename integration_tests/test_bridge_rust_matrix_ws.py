"""Bridge integration — Rust in the cross-runtime matrix (WS-only).

Rust is a peer kernel, same as Python/Swift. These exercise the
restored + asymmetric-rewritten rust kernel_bridge against all
runtimes (forward) + rust↔rust streaming (watch_remote):

  rust→rust (same) · rust→python · python→rust · rust→swift · swift→rust

Each: client = web + web_ws + bridge; server = web + web_ws. Server
spawns first (the bridge connects eagerly); then `boot` is an
idempotent connect guard.
