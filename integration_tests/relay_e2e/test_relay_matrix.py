"""Kernels-through-relay e2e — the any-to-any + same-kind matrix.

Topology per pair: two host kernels each running a `cloud_bridge` agent, BOTH
dialling OUT to one relay; the relay pairs them by (tenant, rendezvous) and
forwards OPAQUE frames; the two cloud_bridges run end-to-end TLS 1.3 mutual auth
and tunnel `kernel.send` `call`/`reply` through it. Done-when: a reflect forwarded
from A round-trips B's root reply through the relay (`tmp/relay_e2e_setup.md`).

The matrix is the 3 host runtimes x 2 (any-to-any + same-kind). A leg runs once
its runtime ships a cloud_bridge transport (CLOUD_BRIDGE_RUNTIMES). Cross-runtime
pinning works because the harness derives each leg's ACTUAL cert the way its own
runtime does -- python via its `_tls` builder, rust/swift via the kernel binary's
`__cloud-cert` subcommand -- and cross-feeds the exact cert to the validating peer.

Heavy + opt-in; skips cleanly when the relay binaries aren't built.
