"""Bridge integration test — Swift ↔ Swift over WS (asymmetric).

Both kernels are Swift. A's `kernel_bridge` opens a WS to B's native
WS server and ships raw `{type:"call", target, payload}` frames;
B's `WebSocket.handleCall` dispatches `kernel.send(target, payload)`
and replies over the same socket. No B-side bridge.

Completes the Python×Swift directed-pair matrix:
  py→py, py→swift, swift→py (other files) + swift→swift (here).

This is also the closest proxy for the Apple app, which embeds the
same `FantasticKernelBridge` + `FantasticWeb` code as the Swift CLI
(via FantasticKernelEmbedded) and is not separately spawnable here.
