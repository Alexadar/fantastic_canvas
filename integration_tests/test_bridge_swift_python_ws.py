"""Bridge integration test — Swift ↔ Python over WS (asymmetric).

Swift A is the client: its `kernel_bridge` opens a WS to Python B's
`web_ws` and ships raw `{type:"call", target, payload}` frames. B's
`web_ws._on_call` dispatches `kernel.send(target, payload)` and
replies over the same socket. No B-side bridge.

When this passes: Swift's `WebSocketTransport` wire shape is
byte-compatible with Python's canonical `web_ws` server. Wire drift
breaks this test loudly.
